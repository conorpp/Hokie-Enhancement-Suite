### Installation

Setting up the environment should be pretty easy.

`git clone https://github.com/conorpp/Hokie-Enhancement-Suite`
    
`Go to chome://extensions`
    
`Click on "Load unpacked extension ..."`
    
`Open Hokie-Enhancement-Suite/client`

You can now make changes and refresh the extension to see them.
    
    
### Structure

The add ons are independent of each other and should have everything they need in their directory.

New add ons need to be added to manifest.json
